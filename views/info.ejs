    <p>Triple Walrus is my third iteration of a slot machine game. The initial version was a command-line game, relying on typed commands for interaction, with the results displayed through rolls and scores.</p>
    <p>The second version, Tripple Walrus 2.0, retained the same concept but introduced a more user-friendly UI. Despite some issues, including a misspelling in the name, it was functional, allowing users to play the game.</p>
    <p>The current version, Triple Walrus 3.0, represents a significant improvement. It includes full animations for the spinning wheels, enhanced score tracking, and an overall more immersive experience. While the app is not flawless, it marks a substantial leap from the previous two versions.</p>
    <p>Looking ahead, I plan to introduce additional features. One key addition will be an option for users to sign in and create accounts, enabling the saving of scores to a database. This will also facilitate the distribution of more tokens if users run out, enhancing the overall gaming experience.</p>
